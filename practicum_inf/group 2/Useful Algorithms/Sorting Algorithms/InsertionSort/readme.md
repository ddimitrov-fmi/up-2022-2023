<h1> Insertion Sort Algorithm </h1>

<h2> Theory </h2>

<p> Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.</p></br>

<p> Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or a list)
one item at a time.</p></br>

<p> Efficient for(quite)small data sets, much like other quadratic sorting algorithms.</p></br>

<p> More efficient in practice than most other simple quadratic (i.e. O(n^2)) algorithms
such as selection sort or bubble sort.</p></br>

<strong>Time Complexity: O(n^2)</strong></br>

<h2> How it works? </h2>

<p><strong> Step 1 - </strong> Pick next element.</p></br>
<p><strong> Step 2 - </strong> Compare with all elements in the sorted sub-list on the left.</p></br>
<p><strong> Step 3 - </strong> Shift all the elements in the sorted sub-list that is 
greater than the value to be sorted.</p></br>
<p><strong> Step 4 - </strong> Repeat until list is sorted.</p>
